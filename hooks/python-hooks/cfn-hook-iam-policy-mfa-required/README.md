# AWSSamples::IamPoliciesRequireMfa::Hook

This AWS CloudFormation Hook validates that MFA is required on all IAM policies, both standalone and inline in IAM Role definitions. This hook validates that the `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` 
property of the `Bool` Condition is not set to `true`.

Below is a sample CloudFormation template that will successfully validate by the hook.
